## 📌 Overview

Welcome to my **portfolio repository** — a curated collection of projects that showcase my work across data science, applied mathematics, and quantum information science.  
Each project reflects the intersection between **theoretical principles** and **practical implementation**, demonstrating how rigorous analytical methods can be applied to real-world and computational problems.

The repository is organized into two main areas:  
1. **Data Science** — focused on analytics, predictive modeling, and machine learning applications.  
2. **Quantum Information Science** — centered on exploring quantum algorithms, simulations, and computational methods.

Feel free to explore the projects, dive into the code, and review the accompanying documentation.
