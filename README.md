## 👋 About Me

I am a physicist and data scientist with broad experience in machine learning, reinforcement learning, quantum optimal control theory, and computational modeling.  
Currently, I work as Lead Data Scientist at **YPF Tecnología S.A. (Y-TEC)**, where I apply advanced analytics, machine learning, and AI to tackle complex challenges in the energy sector.

Previously, I worked at **Cencosud S.A.**, one of the largest retail companies in Latin America. There, I developed customer segmentation models, churn prediction systems, and recommender engines, later serving as Supervisor of the Analytics and Data Science team in the CRM area.  
I also have experience in energy market modeling, where I developed gas marketing strategies using discrete optimization and operations research techniques to support planning and decision-making under contractual constraints.

I hold a **Master’s degree in Physics** from the **National University of La Plata (UNLP)**, where I specialized in quantum optimal control theory and computational physics.  
My research focused on designing algorithms based on shortcuts to adiabaticity for the control of quantum systems and the solution of problems with NP complexity.

My academic foundation in probability, statistics, and applied mathematics is complemented by continuous professional development through graduate and industry-based programs in data science, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing.

I am passionate about bridging theory and practice — transforming mathematical and physical principles into real-world, data-driven solutions.

Outside of work, I have a deep interest in theology and enjoy playing bass guitar in my free time.
