## 📘 Deepen Your Knowledge

If you're interested in a deeper understanding of many core topics covered throughout this portfolio (including **Python programming**, **probability and statistics**, **numerical algorithms**, **machine learning**, and **quantitative finance**) I invite you to explore the book I’m currently writing:

**_Data Science for Quantitative Finance: Theory, Methods, and Applications in Financial Markets_**

📖 The book is written in [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/) and includes chapters such as:

- Programming Fundamentals in Python  
- Linear Algebra  
- Probability and Statistics  
- Numerical Algorithms  
- Statistical Learning  
- Reinforcement Learning  
- Quantitative Finance  
- Advanced Topics and Appendices
