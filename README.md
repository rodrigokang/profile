## Projects

### [Asset Allocation](./asset_allocation)
An in-depth analysis and model development for optimal asset allocation using modern portfolio theory and machine learning techniques.

### [Financial Derivatives](./financial_derivatives)
Modeling and analysis of financial derivatives, exploring pricing, risk management, and trading strategies using quantitative methods.

### [Housing Price](./housing_price)
A project to predict housing prices based on various features using linear regression and other predictive modeling techniques.

### [Retail Customer Segmentation](./retail_dashboard)
A comprehensive project focused on customer segmentation for a retail dataset using the Northwind database. By leveraging RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) variables and scores, this project implements K-Means clustering to segment customers into different clusters. The segmented data is used to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. SQL queries are used to extract and preprocess the data from the database.

### [Blockchain](./blockchain)
Investigating blockchain technology and its applications, including smart contracts, cryptographic security, and decentralized applications.

### [Churn Prediction](./churn)  
Developing machine learning models to predict customer churn in non-contractual relationships within the retail market using an **RFM-based approach**. The project explores various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, to benchmark performance and enhance predictive accuracy. 

### [Quantum Control Theory](./quantum_control_theory)
Projects on the control of quantum systems, focusing on the application of control theory to quantum computing and quantum information processing.

### [Labs](./labs)
This directory is dedicated to exploring and solving problems in probability and statistics, numerical analysis, computational physics and quantitative finance. Each problem is approached using Python, R, and C++, demonstrating a versatile skill set in programming and analytical problem-solving across these diverse fields. It serves as a comprehensive collection of solved problems, designed to deepen understanding and provide practical examples of key concepts, making it a valuable resource for learning and application.
