## About Me

I am a physicist and data scientist with broad experience in machine learning, reinforcement learning, quantum optimal control theory, and computational modeling.  

Currently, I work as Lead Data Scientist at **YPF Tecnología S.A. (Y-TEC)**, where I apply advanced analytics, machine learning, and AI to address complex challenges in the energy sector.

Previously, I worked at **Cencosud S.A.**, one of the largest retail companies in Latin America. There, I developed customer segmentation models, churn prediction systems, and recommender engines, later serving as Supervisor of the Analytics and Data Science team in the CRM area.

I also have experience in energy market modeling, having developed gas marketing strategies using discrete optimization and operations research techniques to support planning and decision-making under contractual constraints.

I hold a **Master’s degree in Physics** from the **National University of La Plata (UNLP)**, where I specialized in quantum optimal control theory and computational physics.  
My research focused on algorithms based on shortcuts to adiabaticity for controlling quantum systems and solving NP-complex problems.

My academic background in probability, statistics, and applied mathematics is complemented by continuous professional development through programs in data science, AI, and quantum computing.

I am passionate about bridging theory and practice — transforming mathematical and physical principles into real-world, data-driven solutions.

Outside of work, I have a deep interest in theology and enjoy playing bass guitar in my free time.
